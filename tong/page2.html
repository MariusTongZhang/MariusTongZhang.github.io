        Still I would maintain :

<p>
The distinction of public and private belongs to the narrative of civic democracy and capitalism. While the public was associated with the open, with politics, gendered towards a male norm, the private referred to the enclosing, to care and reproduction, gendered towards the female. The promise of bourgeois society to men was, that in privacy they could relax from their regulated public work life, dominate their wife and children, while ideally no-one would look behind the curtain. Anonymity in large urban aggregations, was a continuation of this promise. This privilege has been being diminished not only through feminism, but also through the ongoing recording of data, both in public and private, opening the privacy enclosure. »Consumers regard their purchases as private, as part of the capitalist system which designates all economic transactions as >private<. But databases are a postmodern discourse that traverse and cancel the public/private distinction.« (Mark Poster 1995, 86) From this perspective, the discussion about surveillance can also be understood as a reaction to the diminishing of the privacy as an ideology.</p>
<p>The concept of surveillance as »potentially all-encompassing« spreads narcissist fear: »Everybody is concerned, I’m being surveilled, ›they‹ are targeting me.« I think the spreading-fear-aspect is a problem, because the continuous talk about surveillance enforces fear. Unless you are being specifically targeted as in a police investigation, the broad collection of data is always only partial and never ever depicts »who you are«. The data on a single person, collected in databases at distributed locations and under distinct institutional ownership is always incomplete and partial, often even contradictory or simply wrong. It seems as if our collective imagination is better in spectacularly picturing how Facebook can address each participant based on collected statistical data, instead of imagining the agency of each in/dividual in dealing with machinic agency.</p>

<p>The impartiality and contradictoriness of combined data is not only infrastructurally grounded in different formats and contexts of overlapping data, e.g. one data collection models two different genders, another databases’ model allows for more differentiation regarding gender. That’s difficult to consolidate. Impartiality and contradictoriness is also based in our ability to act dividually – in the context of OkCupid I’m another person compared to my local bar, Netflix collects another set of references to my actions compared to the company I’m working for, the school I’m studying at or the social services that provide basic subsistence. The dividual works against an all-encompassing data collection.</p>
<p>Statistical data creation of labor processes, consumption, leisure activities is communicated as surveillance, as if it were something new. I would argue, that we live with it for about at least one century already. Whatever metrics may represent in the contemporary eye, they are just a diagrammatical variation of the instruction cards, described by Frederick W. Taylor, to optimize labor processes (Taylor 1911, 103f., 127f., 138). Looking further it has been argued by Foucault and others, that statistics as a gouvernmental and managerial technique emerged during the 17th century, on the example of King Louis XIV. The one thing, that is of different quality today, is the amount and immediacy of statistics generated, through machinic formalisation. One could be tempted to read this as »growing surveillance«, yet I would argue that it is a continuation of taylorist methods, for creating more value.
